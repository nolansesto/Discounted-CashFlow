(PYTHON) This is a algo DCF "model-er". Meaning you can substitute any given set 4 years of free cash from any public company. Code will then give future predictions on the next 4 years using multiples within the DCF data. In the terminal it will display 4 years of future discount rates, free cash flows and the fair value of 'x' company.
